//HEALTHCARE - CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM PROJECT//

A clinical decision support system (CDSS) project involves the development, implementation, and evaluation of a software tool designed to provide clinicians with relevant medical information to facilitate decision-making or improve adherence to recommended care. The CDSS can be integrated into an EHR (Electronic Health Record) or HMS (Hospital Management Software) system or used as a separate application or part of a patient portal.
